# Hovering Drone with PID Control

## Project Goal: Create a quadcopter that hovers

Problem: Hovering is difficult, especially for a human operator

Solution: Raspberry pi can control drone hover with high precision

Uses accelerometer, electronic speed controllers, motors, and RPI
RPI takes accelerometer data and adjusts speed of propellers
